Twelve Monkeys is a simple memory game, where the goal is to click all 12 monkeys on the page without repeating yourself. Making this task more difficult is the fact that the monkeys shuffle their order after each click.

The user's current score and high score are logged at the top of the page, and the user's high score is updated once the current score is greater than the previous high score.

If a user clicks on a monkey they've previously clicked, they receive a losing message. The score resets to zero and the user can start again.

If a user is able to click all 12 monkeys without clicking the same monkey twice, they receive a winning message. The score will reset, and the user can play again. The highest possible score for the game is 12.

Refreshing the page will always reset both scores to zero.
